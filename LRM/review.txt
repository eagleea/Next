2.2
Actions have identifiers?

2.5 
on should be one

3.1  example

This is a block:
	int x = 1;
	x = x + 1;
	output x;

This is a compund statement:
	{
	int x = 1;
	x = x + 1;
	output x;
	}

3.2
A little redundant:
"but they are not explicitly declared and do not technically have a declaration."

4
Table 5 should probably be in this section

6.4
Missing dot and assignment from clasification of operators

6.4.4
should be "and 0 if they do not:"

7.4.1
else-statement should probably just be statement or statement2. else-statement is confusing i think. Also, the way the parser is set up right now we do not need parentheses in the expression after the if.

example
if x + 1 then output "x was not negative one";
else output "x was negative one";

7.5 
Syntax:
start location_identifier end expression statement

start myplace end junior.life < 1
{
	junior.life = junior.life - 1;
	output "You have reached the mountains of myplace!";
}

7.6.1
Probably should be "The drop statement removes an item from the character's inventory and adds it to the current location"

7.6.3
The way output is set up to work right now it ouputs an expression! ... which is kinda cool
