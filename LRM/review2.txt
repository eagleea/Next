2.4 Ok this is interesting. Start is no longer a statement, it is a declaration, but its not really a data type so on the list of keywords used that will have to change, aybe either put start by itself or change the data type wording to declaration?

5.2 Items_list and character_list members must be declared before they can be used in a character or location

6.4.5
LRM specifies that operands must have arithmetic type but we allow strings as well

6.5 this is not quite true
"Outside of the declaration section, assignment operators can only operate on attributes in Next"

7.2 then for if statement missing

7.5 Might want to make start its own section or put it on declarations. Start is now a kind of declaration and we now need a start statement for every location declared. Also, now all game logic that is not a declaration must go inside the start statement

7.6.2 Pending on what we decide this may have to change to only include locations and not characters
